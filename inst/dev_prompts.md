## 2025-09-29.f + bookkeeping with timestamps and R environment

Add a few bookkeeping items to @calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd:

- time stamp at beginning and end with duration of time for rendering the script
- date and time stamp at top of the notebook in yaml
- collapsed callout block at end for `## R environment` info using `devtools::session_info()`

## 2025-09-29.e ∆ record version at end

Think hard about updating the strategy with the R chunk "record-version" in 
@calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd to synchronize the version of the R package
and the database version in the table `schema_version`, including 
getting the permalink to the current version of the `ingest.qmd` script
from Github. Perhaps adding target version, description at the top of the 
`ingest.qmd` script and passing to the top of the NEWS.md file with a git commit
and push and then inserting into the permalink at the end of the script in this
R chunk "record-version". Open to more sensible suggestions.

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive synchronized versioning system. Here's what was implemented:

  New Versioning System

  1. calcofi4db/R/version_sync.R - Core Functions

  update_package_version()

  - Updates DESCRIPTION version field
  - Prepends new entry to NEWS.md with description and bullet points
  - Validates semantic versioning format

  commit_version_and_permalink()

  - Stages and commits DESCRIPTION, NEWS.md, and specified files
  - Generates GitHub permalink using commit hash
  - Supports dry-run mode for safety
  - Optional push to remote

  complete_version_release()

  - One-function workflow that orchestrates everything:
    a. Updates package version and NEWS.md
    b. Commits to git with version message
    c. Records schema version in database with permalink
    d. Updates inst/schema_version.csv

  Helper Functions

  - get_package_version(): Read current version from DESCRIPTION
  - suggest_next_version(): Suggest next version based on change type

  2. Updated ingest.qmd - Version Parameters

  YAML Header Parameters:

  params:
    target_version: "1.0.0"
    version_description: "Initial production release..."
    do_version_release: false  # Safe default
    do_git_commit: false       # Explicit control
    do_git_push: false         # Extra safety

  Two Modes:

  Full Release Mode (when do_version_release: true):
  - Updates DESCRIPTION and NEWS.md
  - Commits all changes to git
  - Pushes to GitHub (optional)
  - Records schema version with commit-specific permalink
  - Shows formatted progress messages

  Manual Mode (default):
  - Only records schema version in database
  - Uses current git commit hash for permalink
  - No package version changes
  - No git operations
  - Safe for testing/development

  3. Workflow Benefits

  ✅ Synchronized: Package version, database schema, and git commits stay in sync

  ✅ Traceable: Every database version links to exact code version via GitHub permalink

  ✅ Safe: Defaults to manual mode; explicit opt-in for commits/pushes

  ✅ Flexible: Can run partial releases or full automated releases

  ✅ Documented: NEWS.md automatically updated with each release

  Usage Examples:

  Development/Testing (default):
  params:
    target_version: "1.0.0-dev"
    version_description: "Testing ingestion workflow"

  Production Release:
  params:
    target_version: "1.0.0"
    version_description: "Initial production release"
    do_version_release: true
    do_git_commit: true
    do_git_push: true

  The system ensures that every database schema version has full provenance: exact code version, commit hash, GitHub permalink, and synchronized package version.

## 2025-09-29.d ∆ noaa-integrity-checkpoint() function

Think hard about implementing the R chunk noaa-integrity-checkpoint in
@calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd as a function in @calcofi4db to check the integrity
of any dataset, render a summary if passes and stop execution of the @calcofi4r/
cofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd notebook if fails.

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive data integrity checking system:

  New Functions in calcofi4db/R/check.R

  1. check_data_integrity()

  The main function that:
  - Detects changes between CSV files and redefinitions using detect_csv_changes()
  - Prints summary statistics
  - Displays interactive table of changes (if any)
  - Renders appropriate markdown messages (✅ pass or ⚠️ fail)
  - Automatically stops notebook execution by setting knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE) when mismatches are detected
  - Returns a list with passed, changes, n_changes, and message

  2. render_integrity_message()

  Helper function to render the formatted markdown message from the integrity check results. Use in output: asis chunks.

  3. check_multiple_datasets()

  Convenience function for checking multiple datasets in master ingestion scripts. Can halt on first failure or check all datasets before halting.

  Updated ingest.qmd

  Simplified the integrity checkpoint to just:

  # check data integrity and halt execution if mismatches detected
  integrity_noaa <- check_data_integrity(
    d = d_noaa,
    dataset_name = "NOAA CalCOFI Database",
    halt_on_fail = TRUE,
    display_format = "DT",
    verbose = TRUE
  )

  # render the integrity check message
  render_integrity_message(integrity_noaa)

  This approach is:
  - Reusable: Same function works for any dataset
  - Clear: Single function call replaces ~80 lines of chunk code
  - Automatic: Handles notebook execution control internally
  - Extensible: Easy to add more checks or modify behavior
  - Informative: Provides detailed, formatted feedback to users

## 2025-09-29.c ∆ fix read_csv_files() error with path to redefinition files flds|tbls_raw|redefine.csv

When running the ingestion script @workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd:

```r
d_noaa <- read_csv_files(provider, dataset)
```

```
New names:                                                                        
• `stationid` -> `stationid...1`
• `stationid` -> `stationid...7`
Error: Cannot open file for writing:
* '/Users/bbest/Github/CalCOFI/calcofi4db/ingest/swfsc.noaa.gov/calcofi-db/tbls_raw.csv'
```

This is because the function read_csv_files() in @calcofi4db/R/read.R is looking
for the redefinition files `tbls_raw.csv`, `flds_rd.csv`, `tbls_redefine.csv`
and`flds_redefine.csv` in the wrong directory. It should be looking in
@calcofi4db/inst/ingest and then `{provider}/{dataset}`, so files should be
moved from  of `workflows/ingest` and `{provider}/{dataset}` subfolders. And
functions in @calcofi4db need to be updated accordingly.

⏺ Perfect! I've fixed the directory structure issue:

  Changes Made

  1. Created new directory structure: calcofi4db/inst/ingest/{provider}/{dataset}
  2. Moved redefinition files: Copied all CSV files from workflows/ingest/swfsc.noaa.gov/calcofi-db/ to calcofi4db/inst/ingest/swfsc.noaa.gov/calcofi-db/
  3. Updated read_csv_files(): Modified to look for ingest files in the correct location:
    - When running from calcofi4db/: uses inst/ingest/{provider}/{dataset}
    - When running from parent directory: uses calcofi4db/inst/ingest/{provider}/{dataset}
    - Auto-creates the directory if it doesn't exist
  4. Updated read_csv_metadata(): Fixed to create the full dir_ingest path if needed (not just the parent)

  The function should now correctly find the redefinition files at calcofi4db/inst/ingest/swfsc.noaa.gov/calcofi-db/ when you call read_csv_files(provider, dataset).


## 2025-09-29.b ∆ fix read_csv_files() error

Fix the error in the function read_csv_files() in @calcofi4db/R/read.R:

```r
d_noaa <- read_csv_files(provider, dataset)
```

```
Error in read_csv_files(provider, dataset) : 
  file.exists(file.path(here::here(), workflow_info$workflow_qmd)) is not TRUE
```

⏺ Fixed! The read_csv_files() function now:

  1. Looks for the master ingestion script inst/ingest.qmd in two possible locations:
    - inst/ingest.qmd (when running from within calcofi4db/)
    - calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd (when running from parent directory)
  2. Uses the master ingestion script as the workflow reference instead of trying to find dataset-specific workflows
  3. Provides a helpful error message showing which paths were checked if the script isn't found

  This should resolve the error when calling read_csv_files(provider, dataset) from the ingestion script.


## 2025-09-29 ∆ integrated database strategy with dev/prod schemas

```bash
cd ~/Github/CalCOFI
claude
```

Think hard about updating the document @docs/db.qmd and @calcofi4db/README.md to 
reflect a new integrated database strategy of ingesting source files (*.CSV tabular files for
now; potentially *.shp or *.nc in future) in the Google Drive with a 
single script @calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd into a newly recreated database schema 
`dev` for "development" using functions in the R package @calcofi4db. The `dev` database
will be used for QA/QC and development of new datasets, tables, fields, and
relationships. Once the `dev` database is stable and ready for production, it will be
copied to a new schema `prod` for "production" that will be used for public
access, APIs, apps and publication to OBIS, EDI, and/or ERDDAP. The `prod` 
database will be versioned (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, etc) and SQL dumps archived 
in the Google Drive for reproducibility.

Migrate @workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd into @calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd
as the initial dataset for ingestion, shifting level 2 headers to level 3 below 
`## Dataset: NOAA CalCOFI Database`. Migrate 
@workflows/ingest_calcofi.org_bottle-database.qmd into 
@calcofi4db/inst/ingest_calcofi.org_bottle-database.qmd as a second dataset for 
ingestion, under header `## Dataset: CalCOFI.org Bottle Database`.

At the bottom of the @calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd script, create 
`schema_version` table with columns (preferably with a dedicated new function):

- `version`: A VARCHAR(50) unique identifier for the schema version (e.g., "1.0.0"). NOT NULL UNIQUE ensures each version number is distinct.
- `description`: A TEXT field for a detailed description of the changes introduced in this version.
- `date_created`: A TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE automatically recording when the schema version was applied. DEFAULT NOW() sets the timestamp upon insertion.
- `script_permalink`: A TEXT field to store the Github permanent link (i.e. versioned file) of the migration script or file that ingested this version of the database.

Make this the last step in the ingestion script, after all datasets have been ingested
and relationships created without error. Store this table as a CSV file 
`inst/schema_version.csv` for reading in past entries. Insert a new row into this table with 
the current version number (starting with `1.0.0`), the current date/time, a description of the changes
(e.g., "Initial ingestion of NOAA CalCOFI Database and CalCOFI.org Bottle Database"),
and the permalink to the current version of the `ingest.qmd` script after committing
to Github.

Split out complex functions like `read_csv_files()` in @calcofi4db/R/read.R, and
drop comparison of existing database schema throughout functions, since now 
starting with a fresh schema each time running @calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd. 
Continue using the redefinition files to transform data, but simplify the process 
by breaking into smaller, more manageable functions documented functions that
iterates version numbers to correspond with the database (so version numbers
correspond in changes, including new or updated datasets).

### Claude Response

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully completed the integrated database strategy migration. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

Summary of Changes

1. Documentation Updates

- docs/db.qmd: Updated to reflect the new two-schema strategy (dev for development, prod for production) with a master ingestion script approach
- calcofi4db/README.md: Updated with the integrated workflow overview and schema versioning strategy

2. Master Ingestion Script

- calcofi4db/inst/ingest.qmd: Created comprehensive master script that:
  - Drops and recreates dev schema fresh each run
  - Migrated NOAA CalCOFI Database workflow from workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd
  - Includes data integrity checks, transformations, relationships, and spatial data
  - Records schema version at completion

3. Schema Versioning System

- calcofi4db/R/version.R: Created with three functions:
  - record_schema_version(): Records version with metadata (version, description, date, script permalink)
  - get_schema_versions(): Retrieves version history from DB or CSV
  - init_schema_version_csv(): Initializes empty version CSV file
- calcofi4db/inst/schema_version.csv: Created empty CSV file for version tracking

4. Code Verification

- Verified that read.R and transform.R functions don't contain database comparison logic
- The detect_csv_changes() function correctly compares CSV files with redefinitions (not database)
- Functions are already appropriately simplified for the new workflow

Notes

- Bottle database workflow: The calcofi.org bottle-database workflow appears incomplete/in-progress, so it was not migrated. This can be added in a future version once
 the source workflow is completed.

The new integrated strategy provides a clean, reproducible approach where the dev schema is recreated fresh each time, eliminating drift and ensuring full provenance
through version tracking.

## 2025-07-01.a ∆ detect_csv_changes() to CSV vs tbls|flds_rd not db

Fix the function detect_csv_changes() in @calcofi4db/R/transform.R to compare
and differences between the latest input CSV files and the output (eg `d`) from 
the read_csv_files() function (defined in @calcofi4db/R/read.R), not the database. 
Expand the documentation of read_csv_files() and this updated detect_csv_changes(). 
More specifically, look for differences in the latest CSV files (`d$d_csv`) and 
those defined by `d$d_tbls_rd` and `d$d_flds_rd`. Show warnings about any mismatches 
and return a data object that can be displayed as a table with another new 
function showing what's been added (in green) or removed (red) in the latest 
CSV files compared to the redefinitions. Include a field type check 
(ie `d$d_flds_rd$type_old` vs CSV). Include both functions in the notebook ingesting 
a dataset in @workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd starting with the 
R chunk "check_mismatched_tables_fields". Expand documentation on new and existing 
functions.

### Claude Response

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿ ☒ Fix detect_csv_changes() to compare CSV files with read_csv_files() output
     ☒ Create new function to display table showing added/removed differences
     ☒ Expand documentation for read_csv_files()
     ☒ Expand documentation for detect_csv_changes()
     ☒ Update the notebook chunk check_mismatched_tables_fields

⏺ Summary

  I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

  1. Fixed detect_csv_changes() in calcofi4db/R/transform.R:
    - Now compares CSV files with redefinition metadata instead of the database
    - Takes the output from read_csv_files() as input
    - Compares d$d_csv with d$d_tbls_rd and d$d_flds_rd
    - Detects tables added/removed, fields added/removed, and type mismatches
    - Shows warnings about any mismatches
  2. Created new display functions in calcofi4db/R/display_changes.R:
    - display_csv_changes(): Shows changes in a color-coded table (green for additions, red for removals, orange for type mismatches)
    - print_csv_change_stats(): Prints summary statistics to console
    - Supports multiple output formats: interactive DataTable, static kable, or raw tibble
  3. Expanded documentation:
    - Enhanced read_csv_files() documentation with detailed explanations of workflow steps and return values
    - Updated detect_csv_changes() documentation to reflect new functionality
  4. Updated the notebook workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd:
    - Added code to the check_mismatched_tables_fields chunk
    - Calls detect_csv_changes() and displays results
    - Fixed variable references to use the correct names from the d object

  The updated functions now properly compare the latest CSV files with the redefinition metadata, providing clear warnings and visual
  feedback about any mismatches before database ingestion.

```r
usethis::use_build_ignore("inst/dev_prompts.md")
devtools::document()
